* Issues with connecting? Client not closing connection right? People keep getting "nick taken" messages
* When using mood sort, scroll position jumps to last selected chum

* If pesterchum is open but offline due to a network failure and you open the memos screen, it connects you but doesn't fetch the memo list when it finishes connecting
