There is no installing.

Basically this is a mishmosh of source code that will run by invoking:

python pesterchum.py

You will need these libraries:
PyQt >= 4.6 (implies Qt 4.6!)
pygame

The setup files are all broken. If you are building on Mac, Archaemic
has been kind enough to give us a head start in the setup-py2app.py
and py2app.sh files. Check out the MACBUILD file for his comments.

If you are building on Windows, the setup.py file has some
commented-out lines that should give you a clue as to what you need to
do. Talk to me if you reeeeally want to build on Windows.

Linux users should just install PyQt and pygame and then run the
python. It should be simple; any modern Linux repository will have
it. 

Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install python-qt4 python-pygame
Arch Linux: pacman -S pyqt4 python-pygame

The point of all this is that the only person besides myself that I
expect to create builds are the awesome people that volunteer to help
me build on a Mac.
