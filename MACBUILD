<Archaemic> setup-py2app.py, which will create the app
<Archaemic> py2app.sh, which runs setup-py2app.py and does cleanup
<Archaemic> when it says that it can't find py2app/apptemplate/prebuilt/main-i386
<Archaemic> you have to cd into prebuilt and ln -s main-fat3 main-i386
<Archaemic> although I suspect that ln -s main-fat main-i386 works better in this case
