o Bugs:
* REGEXP: \b(\S)(\S*)(\S)\b REPLACE WITH: upper(\1)\2upper(\3) <--
   this regexp, when used as a quirk and then typed in breaks
* import modified.tar
* channels aren't case sensitive! get the real name of a channel
* Windows doesn't show style sheet sometimes?? Maybe related to themes.
* Issues with connecting? Client not closing connection right? People keep getting "nick taken" messages
* Windows XP SP2: sometimes mouse clicks dont register? must be some kinda crash
* don't save pesterClientXXX names
* need to make it so "/" in a memo doesn't mess up the logs

Mac Bugs:
* Mac doesn't show tabs right, display gifs, highlighting thing?
SS: also the background image is broken
SS: in the one-on-one pester it resizes with the window
SS: but the memo one doesn't resize
SS: and the arrows next to the time thing overlap the CLOSE button

Features:
* copy quirks between profiles?
* help button on quirks menu?
* More complex quirks: by-sound
* Theme checking
* Spy mode
* Animated
