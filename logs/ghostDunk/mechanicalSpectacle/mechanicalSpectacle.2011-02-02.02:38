[color=#ff00ff]GD: pestrign[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Oh i![/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: *hi[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: GG told me to pester you[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Wow this window is small XD[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: I know, it's me[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: hehe[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: yeah[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: lol[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: damn you HUSSIe[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Mostly just seeing if the alarm is still wonky :P[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: oh the crappy sound?[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Yup[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i'm debating whether or not to keep it crappy[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Is it a program thing, or simply the WAV?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: its a program thing[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Aww damn[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i have it intentioanlly crappy[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Oh yeah, the comic one sounds like this[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: do you know if AM went to bed[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Looks like he hasn't been on in a while[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: oh huh[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Hmmmm...[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Now I'm just wondering, if the main window is this small, then other than Pesterchum and Trollian, other themes like what 2.5 has will be kinda redundant, won't they?[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Though they'd still look nice[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: ?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: well[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Meh, just me rambling[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: you can always make the window bigger or smaller[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: in your theme[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Really?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: yeah AM just has it intentionally small[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Is that now, or something you have planned later?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: now[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: but you'd have to edit the theme[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: ohhh the theme file[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: ya[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Would the image be formatted to fit?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: oh the main window? no[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Ah[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: XD[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: but[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: you can make themes with bigger or smaller windows[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Yeah good point[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: But I couldn't make a theme anyway, so that leaves me SOL XD[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: oh :([/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: lol[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: beg aquamarinist to make a bigger theme :P[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: I'm sure he will, or I'll keep fiddling[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: BUT once Enamel is made, I'll be like "What other themes?"[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: lol[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: well dont get your hopes too far up[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: XD[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i cant make it fly around your room[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: XD[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: of course ;)[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Besides, that's more Jade's computer and not the Enamel theme itself[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: are you in britain[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: No[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Why do you guess Britain though?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: you spelled it colour[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: and you are up late as hell[/color]

[color=#0000ff]MS: Hehehehe[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Well to be fair[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Just because I'm on the handle doesn't mean people are talking to me[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: really?[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Jade's been lonely lately :([/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i assumed that once you logged on as a canon handle[/color]

[color=#0000ff]MS: Yeah[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: hey he stayed in character[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: What I'm getting annoyed at though are the people who contact Jade to tell her the haps with the trolls[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: (hold that thought, restarting)[/color]
