[color=#ff00ff]GD: huzzah[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: :D[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: well that should take care of blocking[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: unless AM wants a separate window to keep track of everyone[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Huh?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: of all your blocked chums[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: What, like the trollslum?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: ya[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i think it's unnecessary personally[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: That reminds me...[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: If you do impliment a troll slum, it may be good to make it possible for that trollslum to be on the main window[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Like in ENAMEL Awww you knew that was coming :P[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: haha yeah[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: true[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i forgot about that[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: that....may be a later development[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Hey, as long as eventually Enamel opens on my screen, I'll be a happy motherfucker[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: it may be lacknig a trollslum at first?[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Not a problem[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Besides, if I don't use the trollslum it won't matter. It'd just be the aesthetic appeal[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: But[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: yeah i know canon is important[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: What keeps track of blocked people once the conversation is over?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: your user profile[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: I know but[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: How will people unblock people later?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: well[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: right now when i block someone[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: their mood icon turns into an X[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: showing that they're blocked[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Oh cool[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: ya![/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: brb[/color]
