[color=#ff00ff]GD: PESTERCHUM:BLOCK[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Oh noes XD[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: did that give you a "blocked" msg[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Yup[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: nice[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Now do it again and wait a bit, I'll see if the block sticks[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: oh it's not actually doing anything[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Say, 10 seconds or so[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i just typed[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Oh ok[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: "PESTERCHUM:BLOCK"[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: You just typed it like that?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: yeah[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: your client probably prevents you from engaging in such trickery[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: as this one eventually will[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: PESTERCHUM:BLOCK[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: Like that?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: yeah except mine isnt set up to recognize it[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: so it just appearee[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: d[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i spent about 10 minutes talking to this guy testing the client[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: assuming he was aquaMArinist[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: until i found out he wasnt[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: XD He wasn't?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: ya[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: How did you eventually find out?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: he told me[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: because he had no clue of what i was talaking about[/color]
[color=#0000ff]MS: What, he was using AM's handle?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: no[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: but [/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: he was earlier[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: and i saw the log[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: turns out AM had just sent him his copy of the client[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: and it defaulted to his name[/color]
