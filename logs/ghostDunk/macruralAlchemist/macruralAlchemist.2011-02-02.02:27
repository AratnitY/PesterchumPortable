[color=#ff00ff]GD: new version[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Already?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: ya[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: added logging[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: figured i'd repackage it for GG's benefit[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Oh nice[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: instead of making tehm bug you about sending the themes[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: http://www.silhavey.com/src/pesterchum-win-prealpha-0.0.4.zip[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Thanks![/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: logging and colors work[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: did you take the color chooser out of the trollian UI?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: or is it hidden somewheres clever[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Hmm?[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: What do you mean?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: the button you hit to pick your color[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Yes[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: ah ok[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i'll add a menu option[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: I used that button[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: oh![/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: wheres it at[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: I just picked Aradia's timeline for the mood because its closest to this color[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: The button is in the handle window[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: &gt;View &gt; Trolltag[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: oh[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: that actually doesnt change your color[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: shoudl I make it do that[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Well it would be nice[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: you'd have to pick the same tag you're on[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: None of my handles have default colours[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: or should i add a separate color menu[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: For example this one is 700000[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i mean if you want to change it once you've made your handle[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Well saving colours with handles would be great[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: it does[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i guess what i mean is[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Then again I guess I'll end up using multiple versions of the client for different handles anyway[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: the only way to change your color on a handle once you've made it[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: is clicking the color swatch button, which is to the right of the chumhandle [/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Yes[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: on the pesterchum theme[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: should i make a separate menu for that?[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Oh[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Well that's up to you[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: ah ok[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: The button next to the chumhandle is kinda useful[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: oh i mean we'd have both[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Because it allows you to immediately see what colour you have[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: but you've taken that button out of trollian right[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: ?[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: What do you mean?[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: I'm starting to think you are talking to another person than you think you're talking to[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Are you talking to macruralAlchemist right now?[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: yes[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Well I'm not one of the developers[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: i thought i was talking to AM[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: lol[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: I'm merely a beta tester[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Oh lol :V[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: lol i'm asking you how to use our program[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: hahaha[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: oh man[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: sorry[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: It's 0k :P[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: well thanks for trying it out![/color]
[color=#700000]MA: np[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: I like this new version[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: it'll get better :D[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: er...[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: is AM on?[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Dunno[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Who's AM?[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Oh[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: aquaMarinist[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: aka grimlive[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: I might have accidentally kicked him off when logging in[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Because of how his name was the default[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: no it wont kick him off[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: in fact if theres a collision it makes you pick another name[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Hmm[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Then I guess he just isn't online[/color]
[color=#ff00ff]GD: ya[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Well gotta go[/color]
[color=#700000]MA: Cya[/color]
